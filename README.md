*Genomics-and-Bioinformatics-SU-25*

This four-week course is designed for master's and research students interested in the world of genomes and DNA by IISER-KAA (Alumini Association of Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Kolkata) 
Through engaging lectures and interactive sessions, I will be learning how genomes are structured, sequenced, and analyzed. 

Topics include :
   - the Human Genome Project, 
   - the Genome India Project, 
   - genome assemblies, and 
   - tools like the UCSC Genome Browser.
    
I also got to exploreexplore how scientists detect genetic variation, align sequences, and annotate genes.
The course ends with a look at exciting areas like ancient genomes and the active areas of genomic research.
